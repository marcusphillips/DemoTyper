# DemoTyper!
## The typo-free code editor

***

## What is it?
It's bacially [HackerTyper](http://hackertyper.net) meets [Ace code editor](http://ace.ajax.org/). Pre-record your demo text, then when it's go time you can type any nonsense you want—nothing but perfect code will come out!

## How do I run it?
In your browser, open the index.html file, in the ace folder

## Wow!
I know. Please don't read the source though, just marvel at what it does. We literally wrote this overnight at #JSConf.

Also, the Ace code editor is amazing. Thank you guys.


## Are there features?
Sort of!

- Type the character 'ƒ' to make a pause point. On a Mac, that's alt+f. On a PC I think you have to call tech support each time to get an authorization code. Their number is (800) 692-7753.
- During your demo, type the 'ƒ' character again to get past the pause point. The character will not show up in playback mode.
- You can use undo+redo to fix errors you make while drafting your demo code. Just remember that once you redo, you lose all your future history. That made sense when I started typing it, but now it sounds silly.

## TODOS/ideas

- Backspace does an undo for the previous keypress
- Language detection/selection so that ACE properly indents & formats whatever
you're pasting in
- Hosted demo
- Ability to save demos (pastebin.com style)
- No ACE monkeypatching
- Different speed settings? (type 3 + characters at a time)
